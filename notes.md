# Presentation Notes
Contains presenter notes for the flow of the talk & how to get Github's Copilot to actually do what we want. 

## graphs.py

- create doc comment, "Create a bart chart to compare GPT-3 ..."
- autosuggests import of matplotlib and numpy
- `alt + ]` to get full suggestion box from Copilot
- really depends on the internet connection...
- main will usually do a bar chart, but it will also auto-fill `generate_pie_chart_data()` function and work.

## regex.py

This one's about it understanding regular expressions.

## sentiment.py

## conway_life.py

## torchie.py
- remember to add newline after last suggestion, it suggests things better then
